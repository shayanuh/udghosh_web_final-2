Para 1: The Olympic Games are a major international event which includes both summer and winter sports. The modern International Olympic Committee (IOC) introduced the Winter Games for winter and ice sports; the Paralympic Games for athletes with a physical disability; and the Youth Games for teenage athletes. The Summer Olympic Games are held every four years, as are the Winter Games. This means that every two years there is either a Summer or Winter Olympics. The Paralympics are held immediately after the Summer and Winter Games.
<br><br>Para 2: The IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Olympic Games. There are more than 13,000 athletes who compete in the Summer and Winter Olympics in 33 different sports with a total of almost 400 events. Nearly every nation in the world is represented in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Games offer an opportunity to the host country to show off their city to the world.
<br><br>Para 3: The first Olympic Games were held in Olympia, in ancient Greece, from the eighth century BC to the fifth century AD. The first modern games, held by the IOC, were hosted in Athens in 1896. There were fourteen nations represented, and almost 250 athletes took part in 43 events. Women first took part at the Olympic Games which were held in Paris in 1900. <br><br>Para 4: The Paralympic Games were set up in 1948. Sir Ludwig Guttmann organised a sporting event between different hospitals for rehabilitating soldiers. The event, called the Stoke Mandeville Games took place at the same time as the Olympic Games in London. 400 athletes competed in what was called the ‘parallel Olympics’, which later became known as the first Paralympics.
<br><br>Para 5: The IOC allows nations to compete in the Olympic Games even if they are not sovereign countries in their own right. As a result, colonies and territories such as Bermuda and Hong Kong can compete as separate nations even though they are part of another country.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic">The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques[1][2]) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.[3] The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.
Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.[4]

The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.[4]
